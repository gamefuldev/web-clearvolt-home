# Clearvolt Homepage Concept

Static homepage sample for Clearvolt Ltd.

Key requirements from UpWork:

- Creativity & Uniqueness: We're looking for a draft that is not only visually impressive but also unique to our brand. Utilise the parallax effect innovatively to weave our brand story throughout the design.

- Brand Representation: The design should accurately reflect and enhance our brand identity, positioning us as a leader in the renewable energy sector.

- Professionalism: While we aim for creativity, the design must remain sleek and professional, suitable for our industry and appealing to our target audience of commercial businesses.

- Review & Feedback: The draft will be reviewed by our executive team. Be prepared to make revisions based on this feedback to fine-tune the design to our exact specifications.

- Expectations: Submit the initial homepage draft incorporating the discussed parallax effects within the agreed timeline. Provide source files and any necessary documentation that accompanies the design.


We are eager to see how you bring this vision to life with a design that truly stands out and captivates our audience.
